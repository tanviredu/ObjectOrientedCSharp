what is interface and how we work with it
interface its like an abstract class
where you define method without a body

and if any class is bound by a interfce
or we say if any class in inherited/ implementated we say
you must implement the method other wise the program wont run
thats a way of defensive coding that make user bound o follow
the rule

and here is nother point 
suppose you make a class/ot type
there are attribute in this class
like a some filed for the blog
like title.body,author etc
and there is another different program that need to talk to this class
may be apply some crud
now you can make a interface called blogmanager
and when the other will communicate this this class by implementating the class
so they also have to implement the method in the interface and thats how 
they communicate with the class

like  a autor object will communicate with the blog with the blog manager






## suupose every method needs a loggin mechanism 
## to dore other developer to implement loggin mechanism
## you must implementated the method
## so every method have the loggin funcionality
